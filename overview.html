</ul><h2><a name="Description" >DESCRIPTION:</a></h2>
<p>This mixed undergraduate- and graduate-level course examines the challenge of constructing and complying with privacy policies, technical requirements, and legislation. Is privacy a fundamental human right, an outmoded concept, or something inbetween? How should individuals, businesses, and governments consider privacy when developing or employing new technologies or policies? Students in the course will participate in extensive in-class debates of privacy challenges, including the ethical and legal foundations of privacy, development of privacy-related technologies, and the comparative differences between American and European approaches to privacy legislation. Course topics include social networks, surveillance, wiretapping, encryption, and web-based advertising. This course features a semester-long collaboration with an Atlanta-based healthcare company seeking to engage students in real-world privacy challenges; specifically, compliance with federal privacy regulations, assessment of security and privacy policies, and development of new, privacy-sensitive approaches to business analytics.</p>
<h2><a name="Objectives" >OBJECTIVES:</a></h2>
<p>This will course will enable students to understand how privacy is defined, protected, and managed in the areas of technology, policy, and law. Specific objectives include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Examining the state-of-the-art for research and practice in information
  privacy, including methods, tools, notations and processes used in
  information systems;</li>

  <li>Understanding the legal and policy issues surrounding technologies that
  operate on sensitive information;</li>

  <li>Developing the multidisciplinary skills needed to analyze, manage, and
  resolve the challenges associated with privacy, technology, law, and policy;
  </li>

  <li>Gaining a basic grounding for future technical research in privacy via
  the examination of current research issues and problems; and</li>

  <li>Gain experience handling real-world privacy challenges through analysis
  of software and business artifacts using written and oral communication.</li> 

</ol><h2><a name="CoursePurpose" >COURSE PURPOSE:</a></h2><p>There is a great need for qualified privacy professionals in industry and
government. One need look no further than the number of data breaches facing
industry and government institutions. The the privacy field is maturing as
evidenced by the fact that over 13,000 privacy professionals have joined the
<a href="https://www.privacyassociation.org/" >International Association of
  Privacy Professionals</a>. IAPP certification requires an understanding of
technology, law and policy; this course exposes students to the complex
interplay of these areas. This course will guide students in acquiring the
skills needed to effectively design privacy into software in various
contexts.  There is a great need for students to have a course that enables
them to acquire the practical hands-on skills needed to be a successful
privacy professional while also acquiring the basic grounding needed for
more advanced software engineering research.  This course is expected to
increase the practical and research skills of students specializing in
software engineering and privacy.</p><h2><a name="CourseApproach" >COURSE APPROACH:</a></h2><p>This course requires the active participation of students in the course.
Students are expected to read, critique, and discuss the assigned academic
papers.  One paper review will be submitted for a grade each week.  In
addition, some students will be expected to be "on call" to both ask and
respond to questions when discussing papers each day.  There are three
projects this term: a project on the ethics of tracking technologies, a
project on the privacy implications of cloud computing, and a project on the
potential for re-identification of previously de-identified data.</p><h2><a name="CourseText" >COURSE TEXT:</a></h2><p>All required material for this course will be available online through the
course Website.  In addition, students are asked to read the novel, The Circle, by Dave Eggers. There will
be an extensive amount of required reading in the form of academic papers
related to privacy, security, law, and technology as described in the Course
Description.</p>
<p>We can recommend an optional texts that supplement the course for the interested student. This text addresses fundamental aspects of modern privacy concerns resulting from new technologies and policy discussions.&nbsp;</p><h2><a name="AcademicIntegrity" >ACADEMIC INTEGRITY:</a></h2><p>The course process will follow all relevant and appropriate Georgia
Institute of Technology academic regulations (<a href="http://www.honor.gatech.edu" >http://www.honor.gatech.edu</a>)
including those about academic integrity. All students are expected to
maintain traditional standards of academic integrity by giving proper credit
for all work. All suspected cases of academic dishonesty will be aggressively
pursued. A student shall be guilty of a violation of academic integrity if he
or she represents the work of others as his or her own or aid another's
misrepresentation. <strong>Any violation associated with a homework, 
assignment, examination or quiz will result in a zero for the assignment and a
failing grade for the course.</strong> Such violations will be reported to
the Office of Student Conduct, which may impose penalties beyond those by the
instructor.</p><p>Students are encouraged to read the ACM Code of Ethics (<a href="http://www.acm.org/constitution/code.html" >http://www.acm.org/constitution/code.html</a>),
particularly sections 1.3, 1.5, 1.6, 2.2 and 2.4.</p><h2><a name="StudentsWithDisabilities" >STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES:</a></h2><p>The course process will follow all relevant and appropriate Georgia
Institute of Technology academic regulations including those relevant to
students with disabilities. Any students requiring additional assistance due
to disabilities (e.g., learning disabilities) should contact the professor
during the first week of the semester. Students requiring extra time for
examinations and quizzes are asked to make arrangements at least three days
in advance. You may contact the ADAPTS (<a href="http://www.adapts.gatech.edu" >http://www.adapts.gatech.edu</a>)
regarding campus services.</p>
