        <h2><a name="Reviews" >REVIEWS:</a></h2>
<p>All students are expected to read each paper before it is presented. Each week, students are expected to prepare a review for one of the papers to be presented that week consisting of an explicit statement of each of the following for that paper:</p>

<ol>
<li>the bibliographic citation;</li>

<li>a short summary of the thesis of the paper;</li>

<li>a sentence describing the author’s definition of ‘privacy’; and</li>

<li>and one or more questions about the paper</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Each paper review is due by 6:00 pm the day before it is scheduled to be discussed in class.</strong> Late reviews will be docked one letter grade for up to one week after the day it is due, and will not be accepted after that. &nbsp;Paper reviews should be submitted via T-Square. Students will be allowed to drop the lowest grade received for their reviews this semester.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend that students interested in conducting academic research or pursuing a PhD create an annotated bibliography based on the papers presented in this class. Preparing a short summary, similar to the review required by this class, for each paper would, by the end of the semester, comprise an annotated bibliography for future use in advanced studies. To this end, consider the following example (adopted from Lucas Layman):</p>
<p class="indent" >[KED00] Khoumsi, Ahmed, Abdeslam En-Nouaary, Rachida
Dssouli, Mehdi Akalay. "A New Method for Testing Real-Time Systems,"
Proceedings from the Seventh International Conference on real-Time Computing
Systems and Applications (RTCSA), pp. 441-449, December 2000.</p><p class="indent" >Keywords: real-time systems, testing</p><p class="indent" >This paper presents a testing framework that includes
testing for time fault but succeeds in avoiding the state explosion and
inefficiency inherent in previous methods. The main contribution is
presentation of a method to produce test sequences that fully exercises the
system and operates on continues time, rather than discretized time that
generates a tremendous number of test cases representing each minute time
slice. Also, the approach removes many unreachable test-cases generated by
previous methods, thus resulting in a more manageable test suite.
Unfortunately, this is not tested in the real world and is based on a strong
assumption. There is a need to study methods that are not based on previous
methodologies because a new approach will help avoid assumptions so that the
approach will work in the most general case.</p>
<h2 id="required_recommended_and_optional" >REQUIRED, RECOMMENDED, AND OPTIONAL</h2>

<p>This course has three types of papers that must be reviewed: Required, Recommended, and Optional.</p>

<p><strong>Required</strong> papers must be read prior to class. Much of our class is devoted to discussion. It is essential that you read these papers prior to class to ensure a solid discussion. Even if you do not understand large parts of the paper, you will at least learn which parts those are and form some questions about them by attempting to read them on your own prior to class.</p>

<p><strong>Recommended</strong> papers are not required reading. However, we strongly recommend that you at least skim them or flip through them to see if anything sticks out to you as interesting before class. They are absolutely relevant to the discussion, and the instructors may refer to them during the discussion.</p>

<p><strong>Optional</strong> papers are not required reading. We provide these references for the interested student. They are all well-written and relevant on the topic at hand, but we simply couldn’t include them in the full course.</p>

<h2 id="reading_academic_papers" >READING ACADEMIC PAPERS</h2>

<p>This course requires reading a significant amount of academic literature. For many students, this will be an introduction to a rather different kind of writing, and success will require learning a rather different approach to reading. <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~akmassey/posts/2012-02-15-advice-on-reading-academic-papers.html" >Dr. Massey has written some guidlines</a> that may prove useful to the interested reader. If you have any questions about how you should approach the reading, please do not hesitate to ask the course staff.</p>
